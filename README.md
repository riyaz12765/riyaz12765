## ðŸ§  Zeek Details <a id="zeek-details"></a>

 What is Zeek?
Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is an open-source network security monitoring tool. It's not like Wireshark that captures everything, and itâ€™s not a firewall that blocks stuff. Zeek just watches the traffic silently and logs what's happening â€” HTTP, DNS, SSH, FTP, malware activity, etc.

Think of Zeek as a smart CCTV for your network.

ðŸ§  Core Concept of Zeek:
1. Network Traffic Monitoring
Zeek sniffs packets on the network (using something like pcap), and instead of storing all raw packets, it converts it into logs that are easy to analyze.

Example:
If someone visits a website â†’ Zeek logs it into http.log.
If someone does DNS queries â†’ dns.log.
SSH login attempts? â†’ ssh.log.

2. Event-Driven Scripting
Zeek uses its own scripting language. It works based on events like:

A new connection starts â†’ trigger connection_established

An HTTP request is sent â†’ trigger http_request

A file is downloaded â†’ trigger file_downloaded

You can write custom detections using this logic.

3. Log Files = The Goldmine
After Zeek runs, it generates log files like:


Log File	What It Tracks
conn.log	All TCP/UDP connections
http.log	HTTP requests and responses
dns.log	DNS queries
ssh.log	SSH login attempts
weird.log	Suspicious or unexpected behavior
notice.log	Custom alerts (like potential threats)
These logs help in forensics, incident response, and threat hunting.

4. Passive, Not Active
Zeek doesnâ€™t block or interfere with the traffic. It just monitors silently like a ninja ðŸ¥·

ðŸ”§ Example Use Case:
Imagine youâ€™re doing a pentest:

Victim machine: 192.168.1.10

Attacker: 192.168.1.5

Zeek is running in between on a defensive VM

You start a DoS or exploit from attacker â†’ Zeek logs all the suspicious traffic.
You later check conn.log, dns.log, notice.log etc., to see how the attack happened.

âš¡ Why Zeek is Powerful:
Lightweight but powerful

Custom scripts

Works great with other tools like ELK, Splunk, or SIEMs

Real-time alerting possible

If you want, I can also help you write a basic Zeek script or show how to analyze logs after an attack. Just tell me what vibe youâ€™re going for bro ðŸ˜Ž
